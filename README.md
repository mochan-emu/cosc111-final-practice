# COSC 111 Practice questions for the final

Add code so the following unit tests pass.

  1. **Test1FarenheitToCelciusCalc**: Fix the test so that conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius works.

  1. **Test2Freezing**: Fix the test so that the proper string of either at freezing, below freezing or above freezing is returned for the temperature in Fahrenheit.

  1. **Test3FindSmallestNumberDivisible**: Fix the unit test that tests the function to find the smallest number that is divisible by two given numbers. For example, the smallest number divisible by both 6 and 8 is  24. There is no number smaller that both 6 and 8 divides.

  1. **Test4FindArrayRange**: Find the range of the array, i.e. the difference between the smallest and largest number in the array. If the array is [1, 3, 2], the largest is 3 and smallest is 1. Thus, the range is 3-1=2;

  1. **Test5SumOfSum**: Fix the unit test for the function that calculates the sum of the sum of the first n integers n1, n2 and n3. For example, n1=1, n2=2 and n3=2. Then, sum of n1 is 1, sum of n2 is 3 and sum of n3 is 3, with their total sum 7.

  1. **Test6ShapeToString**: Fix the unit test so that the function toString for Circle produces the string "Circle (r=4)" if you constructed a Circle object with radius 4.

  1. **Test7CarPayments**: When you create a new Car object, you give it a name and price. The monthly payment is the price divided equally over 60 months. Fix the unit test so that it stores the name and price and calculates the monthly payment.

  1. **Test8GenerateRandom**: Fix the test so that the we can generate random numbers between the given min and max.

  1. **Test9CreateArray**: Fix the unit test so that an array with the start and end values are generated. For example, if start is 1 and end is 5, the array should be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

  1. **Test10NewGadgetSerial**: Fix the unit test so that a new Gadget object is generated with the same part number but a serial number that is one higher. So, if I had a Gadget with part number 112 and serial number 34, a new Gadget would have the part number 112 but serial number 35.
